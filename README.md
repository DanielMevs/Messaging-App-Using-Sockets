# Messaging-App-Using-Sockets
This example demonstrates polling and streaming in action. If in polling mode, the client will make a request at a set interval to the server, and receive the response accordingly. A socket is a file that lives on your computer that your computer can write to and read from to communicate with another computer. A server will push data through this open, long-lived connection with the socket, creating an instant, 'live' experience. This process is known as streaming and can remedy the server-load created by polling, especially at large scale (use-case should be considered).
